# __HoriSEOn Marketing Agency__
## Unit One HW - due: 12/3/2020
## Project Status: Complete

### __Assignment__
    Our assignment this week was to "clean up" the code of a client named HoriSEOn SEO Marketing. While their homepage was clean, the code building that page could use a "light dusting," so to speak.  

### __Client Request__
    As a marketing agency, 
    I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
    SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

        GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    WHEN I view the source code
    THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    WHEN I view the image elements
    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    WHEN I view the heading attributes
    THEN they fall in sequential order
    WHEN I view the title element
    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

### __Course of Action__
    Focusing on accessibility tags and semantic HTML structure.
